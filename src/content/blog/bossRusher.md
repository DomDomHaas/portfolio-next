Hi There

TL;DR
Is a game with only boss fight fun and can it scale?

Do you love boss fights?
I certainly do! Last Summer I've discovered the BossRush Game Jam, it was clear that I've wanted to participate, only question was what am I going to do?

Boss Characters
I've been on the patreon of Penusbmic for some years, he makes such great pixel art. And because he has a few boss characters available, it felt like the perfect match. Implementing the animations and time it with collision, sfx and vfx was much fun and much work to make it all come together 😄

Outcome
I'm happy with the result so far. While I don't think I have a very elaborate and interesting pattern for a boss fight yet, I see it as a bit of a proof of concept to implement a character with its animations, collision, sfx, vfx. Make a bit of level design with LDtk, scene and music management.

The theme of the game jam was "spin" that's why I've picked characters which have some sort of spin animation. For the player I've made its strong attack, hold B to charge and start spinning the blades, release for a lot of damage. The boss also has a nice little spin move, which is great for indicating an attack. Due to using existing art, and its animation, it was predefined what kind of attacks I could do. But this was fine for me for now.

So the game works like this:
You start at the last bonfire save place of the dungeon just before going to the boss fight. Once you bet the boss it is congrats! To scale up the game there would just be another starter room with the next boss fight, waiting just around the corner.

Right now there is only one boss in the game, and I'd like to add more and start fleshing out the game.

What do you think?
Could this scale with just adding multiple bosses and probably unlock-able characters?
Would it be enough to just have a starter room and a fight room per boss?
Or do you feel there needs to be more in the game?


If you made it this far and would like to see more of the game, give this post a like :)

Cheers
