### Software Design Patterns

While working on the [Fooby](https://fooby.ch) mobile app I've designed and implemented the software architecture for the functional part of the application. Taking care of the requests to the server, the mapping and aggregation of data into the different view models to be used by the UI components.


### Tech stack

The tech stack used at that time was the cross-platform framework xamarin which is based on C# with .NET. <a href="https://bitforge.ch/en/project/fooby/" target="_blank">Bitforge</a> later re-implemented the whole app with flutter (Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin" target="_blank">ended the support for Xamarin on May 1, 2024</a>).
