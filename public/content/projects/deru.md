After graduation in Game Design at the ZHdK, I’ve developed <a href="https://www.deru.ch" target="_blank">DERU – The Art of Cooperation</a>.
It won +10 Awards, including Best Swiss Game 2017 and was self-published in Nov. 2018.

### Game Design

The initial concept was done during the [Global Game Jam 2014](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2014/games/schlicht) with the theme "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are".
Within a group of three game design students: Christian Schmidhalter, Don Schmocker and Dominik Haas. The first prototype was made.
From there on the game design was done in the group, including everyone from the team.  
Three main game design focus points were: Simplicity, Cooperation and Communication.

### Lead Programmer
As the Lead Programmer I was responsible for the overall software architecture with the main of goal "separation of concern".
Taking in consideration different templates for the users input and possible ports to different gaming hardware.
and leading and guide the other programmers.
More specific I’ve programmed systems and logic including menu & user interfaces, input for game pads, multi-layered sfx,
input recording for ghost replays, physic system with particles and its performance optimization
and my favourite field: gameplay programming, player interactions and game feel.

### Roles during the Development
Additional roles were Co-Producer: everything around the project management and supporting team members in the decision process.
Business Contact: I did communicate and organize business arrangements.
