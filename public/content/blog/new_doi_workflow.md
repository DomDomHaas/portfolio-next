# Improved DOI Workflow

We are happy to announce that as of today there are two new features are available on EnviDat:

 - a new workflow for dataset publishing (with a DOI)
 - and a simple way to reorder the authors of a dataset.  
  
  

### Prerequisite
 
- A dataset on EnviDat, ideally ready for publishing

## Dataset Publishing with DOI


The new DOI interaction looks like this:

![doiworkflow](/images/blog/doiworkflow/doiworkflow.gif "doiworkflow")


**But don't just click through as shown in the gif.
Read on to make sure are you understand what two actions "reserving" and "requesting" mean.**


### Reserve a DOI

You can reserve a DOI to be able to copy it for a paper publication. This way the publication of a dataset doesn't block your paper publication.
Just be aware that until the dataset has been published the DOI is not active on Datacite. So DOI-link won't work until then.


### Request Publication

Click on "Request Publication" when you reviewed the information of your dataset and it's data.
As shown in the warning message **some fields can't be changed anymore once the dataset is published.**

When you request publication the EnviDat team will get an email and review the dataset. Keep in mind that
we have a limited understanding of the scientific field so we will review on a technical / communication base.

**So better to ask a colleague who understands your field of work to review your dataset.**


#### Importance of DOIs

EnviDat started the transition to create a DOI for every dataset, it just to be optional until now.
Read more here about the importance of DOIs in [this blog post](https://www.envidat.ch/#/blog/EnviDat_WSLIntern_2023q1.md).

## Reordering of Authors

As an additional minor feature Reordering of Authors is available. Go to one of your dataset on the on the Step Metadata -> Authors.
On the right side in the "Author List Preview", click on the line to expand the drag and drop list.

Simply move an author to the position you want it to be, like shown in this example:

![reordering](/images/blog/doiworkflow/authorreordering.gif "reordering")

When reordering multiple authors make sure to wait for the changes to save before moving another one.


### That's it, happy Halloween!
