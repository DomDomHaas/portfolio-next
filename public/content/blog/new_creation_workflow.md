#  New Dataset Creation

The team at EnviDat is happy to announce the new workflow for dataset creation.
We simplified the creation and editing of datasets and grouped the different information into multiple steps.

## New Creation Workflow

### Prerequisite

For creating a dataset, you need an EnviDat account (sign up via email on the homepage)
and Editor rights (ask the research data manager or leader of your group, they can write to envidat@wsl.ch to request access for you). 



## Workflow Structure

We simplified the steps the users have to go throw when creating a dataset, with the main focus of giving a user-friendly grouping of information which has to be filled out. 
And some steps will have information about the current user already prefilled.
In this blog post we provide details about some steps, for more details read the [blog post about the Editing Workflow](https://www.envidat.ch/#/blog/new_editing_workflow.md).

The Navigation shows the different steps with their status:
- Yellow Number and border: this is the currently selected step
- Gray checkmark: you have to fill in information
- Red checkmark: there are validation errors
- Green checkmark: the step is filled correctly, continue

#### Metadata Information

The Metadata step contains the most information about your dataset, it's split up into multiple sub steps.
And for example, in the Header Information step, your contact information is already prefilled as the contact of the dataset.
Description, Keywords and Authors your have to provide. For Authors, we also prefilled your information.

#### Data & Resources

The Dataset Creation is all about metadata once you have saved the dataset, you can upload files under the Data & Resources step.

![Data Steps](/images/blog/creationworkflow/cw_data_steps.jpg "Data Steps")

Under the Publication Information step, you just have to add the Funding information and choose the organization.
That is the WSL group, you want the dataset to be published under.

## Sign In & Create

To start, sign in into your EnviDat account and click on the yellow "New Dataset" button.
It brings you to the new creation workflow.

Make sure you read the little introduction on top.

TL;DR:
- Fill out all metadata first until your progress shows 100%
- then save the dataset on the server
- then you are able to upload research data & resources

When creating a dataset, you can leave the creation workflow any time and come back again to continue.
Your information is saved **only the local storage of the browser on this computer** until you save it on
the EnviDat Server!


### Progress

On the top right of the workflow overview the progress is shown for all the steps

![Progress](/images/blog/creationworkflow/cw_progress.gif "Progress")

Once you have filled everything that is needed, the button to save with the disk icon is active.
Now you can save the datasets on the EnviDat server.

### Dataset Contact

Your contact information is prefilled here.
If someone else is the contact, for example, your group leader.
Pick it from the list of existing EnviDat Users, if you can't find the user in the list you can add the information manually.

### Add Authors

When adding an author to the list, please check first if you can pick it from the list of existing authors.

![Authors List](/images/blog/creationworkflow/cw_authors_list.gif "Authors List")


If the author is not in the list, you can add a new one like shown here:

![New Authors](/images/blog/creationworkflow/cw_new_author.gif "New Author")

Make sure you change the focus after entering all the authors information.
That means, click outside any text field.


### First author and author sequence

As mentioned, your information is already prefilled, but you might what to have a different first author?
Or have to change the sequence of the authors? 

*Edit* 

Reordering of Authors is now available [Read more here](https://www.envidat.ch/#/blog/new_doi_workflow.md).
